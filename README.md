# Macro Deck Client for Macro Deck 2
Companion app for Macro Deck 2

The Macro Deck client is only for Android for now. If you want to use Macro Deck with an incompatible device, you can also give the [Macro Deck web client](http://web.macrodeck.org) a try.

# Compatible devices
In theory all Android devices with Android 5 and above should be compatible but in reality it is mostly different.

Here is a list of verfied devices where the Macro Deck Client runs without problems. If Macro Deck Client runs well on your device, please add it to the list via a pull request.
